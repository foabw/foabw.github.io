## Events and Work throughout the year

### Conservation

The Conservation Volunteers meet at 10.00 a.m on the 3rd Saturday of each month throughout the year, for 2 -3 hours. 

The meeting place is at the Thatched Cottage in Bolnore Village. It is conveniently close to our new tool store.  If you live outside Bolnore Village, the Thatched Cottage is accessible via the Bridleway from Ashenground Railway Bridge. The meeting place is where Renfields crosses the Bridleway.  

Not all the work involves coppicing – we are also busy mowing the grassy places, and cutting back path edges, or litter picking and other light work if you prefer, as any help is appreciated. All tools are provided.

You don’t need experience – training will be given.  Please wear stout footwear.

Members and non-members are welcome, but under 18s and vulnerable adults must be accompanied by a responsible adult, who will be responsible for them throughout.

## Information Lecterns

Mid Sussex District Council have placed Information Lecterns in Pond Meadow, The Great Spreading Oak in Renfields, Railway Path, Boundary Path (near School), Renfields top of Bridleway, Catts Wood and Bolnore Wood. New noticeboard at entrance to the Bridleway via railway bridge.

**Sussex Stag Beetle Initiative** would like you to consider making a home in your garden for Stag Beetles. It is very simple, see their instructions – click on the poster below. These fabulous creatures are our largest native beetle and they are under threat. The adult beetle only lives for a few weeks in the summer, their breeding season is very short. Their larvae develop underground, this takes several years, they live on rotting wood during this time, building up fat stores until they develop in to adults. The females remain in the area, the males fly off in pursuit of a female. (For more details of Sussex Stag Beetle Initiative, please go to their Facebook page)
