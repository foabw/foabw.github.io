Friends of Ashenground and Bolnore Woods is made up of local people, including walkers, nature lovers, dog owners and family groups, interested in caring for the Woods. New members are always welcome. The group organises a regular program of task days, nature walks and special interest events, monitors and influences development of the surrounding area, and promotes responsible use by local residents.

Task days involve work in the woodland, including coppicing, as well as more straight forward tasks such as litter picking. Flora and fauna surveys are carried out to monitor carefully any changes in species over time. Links with local schools and other developments are a key aspect of planning for the future.

Regular newsletters are produced and contributions from members are always welcome.
